# Poisson Simulation


1- Generate 1000 Poisson distributed random numbers with parameter ùúÜ = 5 (poissrnd)*. 

2- Get the histogram of the data and normalize the counts so that the histogram sums to 1 (hist ‚Äì the version that returns 2 outputs N and X, sum). 

3- Plot the normalized histogram (which is now a probability mass function) as a bar graph (bar). 

4- Hold on and also plot the actual Poisson probability mass function with l = 5 as a line (poisspdf). 

5- You can try doing this with more than 1000 samples from the Poisson distribution to get better agreement between the two. 

***Hint: By default hist gives 10 equally-spaced bins; One bar for each non-negative integer.***
